üêÑüêñüêì Livestock Management Portfolio | Practical Experience in Farm Operations
This repository serves as a professional portfolio, documenting hands-on experience and core competencies developed during internships across commercial Cattle (Beef/Dairy), Piggery, and Poultry farm operations.

My focus is on sustainable production, effective disease management, optimizing feed conversion ratios (FCR), and ensuring compliance with animal welfare standards.

üõ†Ô∏è Core Management Competencies
The experience gained from these internships demonstrates proficiency in the following critical areas of modern livestock production:

Area

Description

Animal Health & Welfare

Implementing vaccination schedules, recognizing early signs of disease, administering routine treatments, and ensuring optimal living conditions (ventilation, sanitation).

Nutritional Management

Monitoring feed intake, calculating and verifying Feed Conversion Ratios (FCR), and adjusting diets based on growth stage and production goals (e.g., egg production, weaning weight).

Data & Record Keeping

Maintaining accurate records for breeding cycles, births/hatch rates, mortality, weight gain, and inventory management using both manual logs and digital tools.

Operational Efficiency

Managing facility maintenance, waste disposal protocols (manure/effluent), and optimizing workflow for daily routines (feeding, cleaning, inspection).

Reproduction & Breeding

Assisting with breeding programs, including heat detection, artificial insemination (AI) support, farrowing/calving assistance, and post-birth care.

üêî Detailed Poultry Farm Experience
My internship experience covered both broiler and layer operations, focusing heavily on environmental control and flock health.

Focus Area

Key Responsibilities & Achievements

Flock Management

Daily monitoring of water and feed consumption; adjusting environmental controls (temperature, humidity, lighting) to maximize comfort and productivity.

Disease Prevention

Executed routine sanitation programs (all-in, all-out), prepared and administered drinking water vaccinations, and performed post-mortem examinations to diagnose causes of mortality.

Egg/Meat Production

In layer operations, managed egg collection and grading protocols; in broiler operations, focused on achieving target weights and minimizing FCR.

Facility Audit

Ensured feeders, ventilation fans, and cooling pads were fully operational to maintain optimal housing conditions.

üêñ Detailed Piggery Management Experience
Experience spanned farrow-to-finish operations, with a strong emphasis on neonatal care and the management of breeding sows.

Focus Area

Key Responsibilities & Achievements

Farrowing Management

Assisted with farrowing, ensured adequate colostrum intake for piglets, and performed necessary processing procedures (iron shots, teeth clipping, tail docking).

Breeding & Gestation

Practiced heat detection techniques and assisted with Artificial Insemination (AI) of sows. Managed daily feeding for pregnant and lactating sows.

Weaner to Finisher

Monitored pen conditions and group dynamics to reduce stress. Managed diet transitions and administered feed additives/medications as required.

Biosecurity

Enforced strict hygiene protocols to prevent the spread of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) and other common pig diseases.

üêÑ Detailed Cattle Farm Experience
Experience included both Beef (feedlot/cow-calf) and Dairy sectors, providing versatility in large animal handling.

Focus Area

Key Responsibilities & Achievements

Herd Health

Assisted the veterinarian with routine vaccinations, deworming, and treatment of common ailments (e.g., mastitis in dairy, foot rot in beef).

Dairy Operations

Managed pre-milking routines, operated milking equipment (parlor/robot), and recorded milk yield data for individual cows.

Calf Rearing

Managed colostrum delivery, bottle/bucket feeding, and transition feeding. Maintained sanitary conditions in calf hutches to minimize scours.

Handling & Safety

Skilled in low-stress livestock handling (LSHT) techniques for moving, loading, and restraining large animals safely.

üîó Contact & Next Steps
I am actively seeking opportunities in livestock production, farm management, or agricultural technology.
